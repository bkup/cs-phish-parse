# cs-phish-parse
Parses TSV output data generated by the Cobalt Strike Phishing module.  Will calculate statistics on a per campaign basis for total emails sent, unique targets who clicked, and unique click rate.

To generate TSV data: On the Cobalt Strike console navigate to Reports > Export Data and save in your desired path.  When the cs-phish-parse script is executed, type in the path to the TSV files.  The script will identify if the necessary files are missing.  The needed files are: campaigns.tsv, sentemail.tsv, webhits.tsv, and tokens.tsv
